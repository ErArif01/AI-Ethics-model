## Perception Simulations:
  ## Visual Perception:
   -- Simulations that replicate how human process visual information, such as recognizing objects, faces, and patterns.

  ## Auditory Perception:
    -- Simulations that model how the auditory system processes sounds and speech.


## Memory and Learning Simulations:
  ## Working Memory Models:
    -- Simulations that emulate the processes involved in working memory, which is crucial for tasks like problem-solving and decision-making.

## Episodic Memory Models: 
-- Simulataions that attempt to replicate the encoding, storage, and retrival of episodic memories.
